# Hi there:)

I transfered all the coding data for the paper regarding the dementia diagnosis difference across eight ethnic groups on 22 Nov 2024.

Coding from data cleaning to table creation, data analysis, regression will be updated and stored in the repo here.

This is for keeping a good version control and more availability of data sharing to work teammates or a wider readers after the paper publication.

Thank you!
